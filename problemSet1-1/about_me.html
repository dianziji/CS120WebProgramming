    <h2>Trip </h2>
    <p>
        Last summer, I had an unforgettable trip to Philadelphia, a city steeped in rich American history and vibrant
        culture. Wandering through the cobblestone streets of Old City, I felt a deep connection to the past, especially
        while visiting the iconic Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The Philadelphia Museum of Art was another
        highlight, not just for its vast collection of artworks but also for the famous 'Rocky' steps leading to its
        entrance. Of course, no visit to Philly would be complete without indulging in a classic Philly cheesesteak,
        which I savored at one of the local favorite spots. The blend of historical significance, diverse culinary
        experiences, and the warm, welcoming nature of the city made my trip to Philadelphia truly memorable.

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <a href="https://lecoucou.com/" target="_blank">le coucou</a>

    <p>
        My fondness for Le Coucou in New York stems from an unforgettable dining experience that combined exquisite
        French cuisine with an elegant, inviting atmosphere, making it a memorable part of my culinary adventures. The
        impeccable service and the beautifully crafted dishes, especially the Ris de veau Ã  l'estragon - the veal
        sweetbreads and the Canette a l'orange which is the roasted duckling for two, left a
        lasting impression on me.

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>

    <p>
        Gathering around a steaming hotpot, I relish the communal joy of cooking a variety of fresh ingredients like
        meats and vegetables in the rich, flavorful broth. It's a delightfully interactive dining experience where each
        person can create their unique, delicious combinations, enhancing both the meal and the moment.
